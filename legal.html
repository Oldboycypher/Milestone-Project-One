				<h4>1. Data protection principles.<br>
                       Trade Safe TM ( hereafter known as "the company" or "the companies" ) is committed to processing data in accordance with its responsibilities under the GDPR.

					<br>a.	processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to individuals;
					<br>b.	collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes;
					<br>c.	adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed;

					<br>e.	kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required by the GDPR in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of individuals; and
					<br>f.	processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures.”<br>

					<br>3. Lawful, fair and transparent processing
					<br>a.	To ensure its processing of data is lawful, fair and transparent, "the company" shall maintain a Register of Systems.
					<br>b.	The Register of Systems shall be reviewed at least annually.
					<br>c.	Individuals have the right to access their personal data and any such requests made to "the company" shall be dealt with in a timely manner.<br>
					<br>4. Lawful purposes

					<br>b.	"The company" shall note the appropriate lawful basis in the Register of Systems.
					<br>c.	Where consent is relied upon as a lawful basis for processing data, evidence of opt-in  consent shall be kept with the personal data.
					<br>d.	Where communications are sent to individuals based on their consent, the option for the individual to revoke their consent should be clearly available and systems should be in place to ensure such revocation is reflected accurately in "the companies" systems.<br>
					<br>5. Data minimisation
					<br>a.	"The company" shall ensure that personal data are adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed.
					<br>6. Accuracy
					<br>a.	"The company" shall take reasonable steps to ensure personal data is accurate.
					<br>b.	Where necessary for the lawful basis on which data is processed, steps shall be put in place to ensure that personal data is kept up to date.
					<br>7. Archiving / removal
					<br>a.	To ensure that personal data is kept for no longer than necessary, "the company" shall put in place an archiving policy for each area in which personal data is processed and review this process annually.

					<br>8. Security

					<br>d.	Appropriate back-up and disaster recovery solutions shall be in place.<br>
					<br>9. Breach
					<br>In the event of a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data, "the company" shall promptly assess the risk to people’s rights and freedoms and if appropriate report this breach to the ICO (more information on the ICO website).<br>
